    "As we already discussed above, the **text search** using BM25 only returns results containing and exact match for our query terms, in this case only matching three documents. We know with certainty that these three documents are relevant to our query, making the *precision* of this approach very high. However, many documents are missing, even ones that contain a pluralized form of our search terms (eg. \"monsters\"), making the *recall* of this approach poor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The top 5 **vector search** results are also all relevant to our query, containing mentions of \"monsters\", \"beasts\", \"Frankenstein\" (also a 'monster') a \"shape-shifting alien\" and \"ogre\", though only two of the three documents retrieved by the text search approach appear in the 10 results retrieved using vector search (documents 719 and 401). \"Bride of Frankenstein\" seems to be missing in the top 10. There are also some documents returned that don't seem to be relevant, for example documents 58, 740 and 984 (though they may still be 'scary'? Actually, no. \"The Muppet Movie\" and \"Wreck-It Ralph\" are certainly not scary). Nonetheless, the vector search approach here does quite well as it goes on latent representations of our data, capturing content with similar meanings such as `beasts, threat, ogre, victims` and is thereby able to successfully retrieve quite a few relevant documents (7 out of 10), with only a few non-relevant entries. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's finally take a look at the **hybrid search** results, the top 5 of which contain our exact matches (documents 719, 401, 716) from the text search approach! This is because these documents got a higher combined score from the BM25 component in our hybrid scoring calculation. The rest of the results are filled in by the vector search component, showing improved results over a simple BM25 search, but still incorporating the advantages of this symbolic search approach into the hybrid search. Although \"The Muppet Movie\" and \"Wreck-It Ralph\" (our non-relevant results) still appear in the top 10, they've been pushed down the list, making way for more relevant search results."
